# How to use  {#sec-howtouse}

1.  Go to [https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages)
1.  Open the `titlepages` folder
2.  Pick a title page, eg. `vline` or `bg-image`
3.  Download (or copy) all the `.tex` files. Typically this is the `before-body.tex`, `_titlepage.tex`, and `in-header.tex` files, but there may be more. *How?* Clone the repo or click on "raw" and copy and paste the code into your own file.
4.  You can download (or copy) `article.qmd` to use as a template and so you know how the YAML is specified for the template you are using.

In the YAML of your qmd document or `index.qmd` file for a Quarto book project, add this to the PDF format section:

## Article class `scrartcl`

Adding `number-sections: true` will number the chapters and sections. Remove if you don't want that.

```
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrartcl
    number-sections: true
    template-partials:
      - "before-body.tex"
      - "_titlepage.tex" 
    include-in-header: 
      - "in-header.tex"
```

## Book class `scrbook`

The class option "onepage" makes the margins of the even and odd pages the same. The class option "openany" allows chapters and parts to start on even or odd pages; the default is to only start chapters and parts on odd pages.

```
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrbook
    classoption: ["onepage", "openany"]
    template-partials:
      - "template/before-body.tex"
      - "template/_titlepage.tex" 
    include-in-header: 
      - "template/in-header.tex"
```

## How do I add a table of contents

You can add a table of contents (`toc: true`), list of figures (`lof: true`) and list of tables (`lot: true`). The depth of the TOC is specified with `toc-depth`. Example:

```
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrartcl
    template-partials:
      - "before-body.tex"
      - "_titlepage.tex" 
    include-in-header: 
      - "in-header.tex"
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    lof: true
    lot: true
```
