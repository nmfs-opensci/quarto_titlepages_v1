# Pandoc template help

The files that appear in the template-partials: line of the YAML are Pandoc Templates with LaTeX
Pandoc templating [](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates)

`$--` is a Pandoc comment
`%` is a LaTeX comment

## Comments

To comment out a line in a pandoc template, use `$--`.
```
$-- this is a comment
```

## If statements

```
$if(subtitle)$ ... $endif$
```

Here `subtitle` is true if the YAML has "subtitle: " and false otherwise

`$subtitle$` (with `$..$`) is the value of subtitle in the YAML

```
$if(subtitle)${\large\textit{$subtitle$}}$endif$ 
```
prints the subtitle in large text. `\large` is LaTeX

`$if(by-author/allbutlast)$` means if there is more than one author
since if there is only one author then there is no "allbutlast" value

`$if(by-author/last)$` tests if there is a last author. If there is at least one author, this will be true.

## for loops

The basic syntax is `$for(mylist)$ ... $sep$ ... $endfor$` where the value after `$sep$` specifies what separates each value in the list.  Let's say in your yaml, you have `mylist: ["one", "two", "three"]`.

```
$for(mylist)${\large{$mylist$}}$sep$ AND $endfor$%
```
Would put `one AND two AND three` in your tex file.

**Authors and affiliations** The [Quarto author filter](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/filters/common/authors.lua) sets up lists of the unique authors and affiliations that you can use. See the `title.tex` and `before-body.tex` examples in https://github.com/quarto-journals.

```
$for(by-author)$%
{\large{$by-author.name.literal$}}$sep${\large{ AND }}
$endfor$%
```

This is a for loop across all the authors and prints each author name. The `$sep$` bit says what to put between the names. In this case it would be AND. So `Jane Doe AND Ashkar Kumar`

## Include other templates

You can include other files in your template partials. Let's say you have a file called `_titlepage.tex`. You can include it in another template by putting `()` after the name of the file:

```
$_titlepage.tex()$
```

Make sure to list the file in your yaml. The `_` in front of the name is just to help you make sure you don't accidentally use one of Pandoc's reserved names (like `title.tex`).

```
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrartcl 
    number-sections: true
    template-partials:
      - "before-body.tex"
      - "_titlepage.tex" 
```

## Number appearances

The Pandoc template can number the author affiliations and will figure the duplicates. 

```
$for(by-author)$%
{\large{$by-author.name.literal$}}%
$for(by-author.affiliations)$%
{\textsuperscript{$it.number$}}$sep$\textsuperscript{,}%
$endfor$%
$sep$, %
$endfor$
```

This is assigning a number to each affiliation name and then adds it as a superscript to the author name. It will figure out the duplicates.
