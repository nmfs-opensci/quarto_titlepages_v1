# How to modify

## Modifying Pandoc templates sounds like fun!!

Start modifying the files in one of the template title pages. Currently this is `vline` and `bg-image`.

## Are you kidding me? 

**No way! I have a static title page and I want to use that.** 

Go to one of the static examples (end in `-static`) and modify there.

What's the difference? They both are being listed in template-partials in the YAML. `-static` is using a static title page. It is not using the values from the YAML at all. However `before-body.tex` still needs to be listed in template-partials to override the template that Quarto (and Pandoc) uses.

## How it works

-   Defines titlepage or frontmatter via a pandoc template in `before-body.tex`.
-   Passes that template in via `template-partials`. This is needed so that you can reference the YAML variables, things like `author`.
-   Specifies the extra things (packages) that are needed for the LaTeX header in `in-header.tex`.

## The YAML - example

    format:
      pdf:
        documentclass: scrartcl 
        number-sections: true
        template-partials:
          - "before-body.tex"
          - "_titlepage.tex" 
        include-in-header: 
          - "in-header.tex"
        toc: true
        lof: true
        lot: true

## What is going on:

LaTeX document class affects the look; `scrartcl` or `srcbook` are the Quarto defaults. The `cls` folder in the repo has a few more in it.

        documentclass: scrartcl

Articles generally don't have `#` (header 1) but instead just use `##` (header 2). If you use, `#` (header 1) in `scrartcl`, then you need to set

        number-sections: true 

so the numbering isn't whack.

This is the custom title page stuff. You don't need to have the `.tex` files in the base directory. Often these files are stored in a `tex` or `partials` directory. If you do that, add the directory to the file, e.g. `partials/before-body.tex`.

        template-partials:
          - "before-body.tex"
          - "_titlepage.tex" 
        include-in-header: 
          - "in-header.tex"

Next bit indicates if you want table of contents (toc), list of fig (lof), or list of tables (lot).

        toc: true
        lof: true
        lot: true
